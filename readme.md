This assignment is about Test Automation with JUnit.

The project that should be tested is an Implementation of a Stack. 

As requested, we implemented the Test-Methods testIsEmpty(), testIsNotEmpty() and testPushPop(). Furthermore, we added some own testing functions: testPushedTooMuch(), testPoppedTooMuch(). Every step got documented in the LabReport.

We learned:
  
  -> how to automate tests easily with the Framework JUnit

  -> the basic commands and functionalities of JUnit

  -> how to implement automated tests on our own
